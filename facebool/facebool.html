        “You can talk with someone for years, everyday, and still, it won't mean as much as what you can have when you
        sit in front of someone, not saying a word, yet you feel that person with your heart, you feel like you have
        known the person for forever.... connections are made with the heart, not the tongue.”

        “Even if you cannot change all the people around you, you can change the people you choose to be around. Life is
        too short to waste your time on people who don’t respect, appreciate, and value you. Spend your life with people
        who make you smile, laugh, and feel loved.”

        “Don't Just

        Don't just learn, experience.
        Don't just read, absorb.
        Don't just change, transform.
        Don't just relate, advocate.
        Don't just promise, prove.
        Don't just criticize, encourage.
        Don't just think, ponder.
        Don't just take, give.
        Don't just see, feel.
        Don’t just dream, do.
        Don't just hear, listen.
        Don't just talk, act.
        Don't just tell, show.
        Don't just exist, live.”

        “We have to allow ourselves to be loved by the people who really love us, the people who really matter. Too much
        of the time, we are blinded by our own pursuits of people to love us, people that don't even matter, while all
        that time we waste and the people who do love us have to stand on the sidewalk and watch us beg in the streets!
        It's time to put an end to this. It's time for us to let ourselves be loved.”

        “Maybe you can afford to wait. Maybe for you there's a tomorrow. Maybe for you there's one thousand tomorrows,
        or three thousand, or ten, so much time you can bathe in it, roll around it, let it slide like coins through you
        fingers. So much time you can waste it.
        But for some of us there's only today. And the truth is, you never really know.”

        “One day our descendants will think it incredible that we paid so much attention to things like the amount of
        melanin in our skin or the shape of our eyes or our gender instead of the unique identities of each of us as
        complex human beings.
        <h2>— Franklin Thomas</h2>

    <div class="static">
        “Inequality, in all its forms — gender, LGBTQ, racial, or otherwise — is an issue that every company must
        address for its own benefit and to create a better world. We believe businesses need to focus on closing the
        equality gap with the same energy put into creating new products and markets.”

        “There will not be a magic day when we wake up and it’s now okay to express ourselves publicly. We make that day
        by doing things publicly until it’s simply the way things are.”

    <div class="static">
        “Today, I choose to live with gratitude for the love that fills my heart, the peace that rests within my spirit,
        and the voice of hope that says all things are possible.”

        “Gratitude, like faith, is a muscle. The more you use it, the stronger it grows, and the more power you have to
        use it on your behalf. If you do not practice gratefulness, its benefaction will go unnoticed, and your capacity
        to draw on its gifts will be diminished. To be grateful is to find blessings in everything. This is the most
        powerful attitude to adopt, for there are blessings in everything.”
